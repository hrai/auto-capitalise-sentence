// üïí Debounced Capitalization Feature - Implementation Summary
// ===========================================================

/**
 * FEATURE: 5-Second Sliding Window Debounce for Text Capitalization
 *
 * PROBLEM SOLVED:
 * - Prevents excessive capitalization calls during rapid typing
 * - Implements sliding window delay where each new change resets the timer
 * - Only processes the final text change after 5 seconds of inactivity
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
 *
 * 1. Core Debounce Function (utils.js)
 *    - debounce(func, delay): Generic debounce utility
 *    - Uses clearTimeout/setTimeout for sliding window effect
 *    - Each new call cancels previous timer and starts new one
 *
 * 2. Per-Element Debouncing (utils.js)
 *    - getDebouncedCapitaliseText(element, delay = 5000)
 *    - Uses WeakMap to store debounced functions per DOM element
 *    - Each element has independent timer - typing in different fields won't interfere
 *    - Default 5-second delay as requested
 *
 * 3. Integration (content.js)
 *    - Modified capitaliseText() function to use debounced version
 *    - All input event handlers now use sliding window delay
 *    - DOM mutation observers also use debounced capitalization
 *
 * BEHAVIOR:
 *
 * Before (immediate):
 * User types: "H" -> capitalizes immediately
 * User types: "e" -> capitalizes immediately
 * User types: "l" -> capitalizes immediately
 * User types: "l" -> capitalizes immediately
 * User types: "o" -> capitalizes immediately
 * Result: 5 capitalization calls
 *
 * After (5-second sliding window):
 * User types: "H" -> timer starts (5s)
 * User types: "e" -> timer resets (5s from now)
 * User types: "l" -> timer resets (5s from now)
 * User types: "l" -> timer resets (5s from now)
 * User types: "o" -> timer resets (5s from now)
 * [5 seconds of no typing]
 * -> capitalizes once with final text "Hello"
 * Result: 1 capitalization call
 *
 * TESTING:
 * - Comprehensive unit tests with Jest fake timers
 * - Tests sliding window behavior (timer reset on new calls)
 * - Tests per-element independence
 * - Tests function context and argument preservation
 * - Tests default 5-second delay
 *
 * FILES MODIFIED:
 * ‚úÖ src/utils.js - Added debounce functions
 * ‚úÖ src/content.js - Modified capitaliseText to use debounced version
 * ‚úÖ test/util.test.js - Added comprehensive debounce tests
 *
 * PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
 * - Reduces CPU usage during rapid typing
 * - Prevents UI flickering from constant text updates
 * - Improves user experience with smoother interaction
 * - Maintains responsiveness while preventing over-processing
 *
 * USER EXPERIENCE:
 * - Typing feels natural and responsive
 * - Capitalization happens after user finishes typing
 * - No interruption during active typing
 * - Different input fields work independently
